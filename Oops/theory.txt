Classes are the group of entities and Objects are the entities in the real world. We can also say that, classes are the logical entities and objects
are the physical constructs which carry class's attributes and properties.
Class is nothing but the blueprint of an object. Classes are consists of attributes/properties and behaviours/functions.

An object is the real time entity of a class which has four characteristics 
--> Attribute
--> Behaviour 
--> State 
--> Identity
i) Attribute defined about the object.
ii) Behaviour is how object react with the system.
iii) State is a set of properties which can take different values 
    in different times in the object's life. Generally an object has two states, live state and dead state.
    Whenever object executes in an operation we consider it to be in live state, otherwise the object is in the dead state.
iv) Identity is a unique property by which we can distinguish between two objects.

So, class is nothing but the container where we collect attributes and behaviours of similar types of the objects. We can declare variables inside a 
class. Those variables are called instance variables. These are nothing but the attributes of the objects.
similarly we can define methods inside a class. Those methods are called instance methods. These are nothing but the behaviours of the objects.
Then we make objects of class in the main method and access the attributes and behaviours of that particular class.

Common properties of OOP is given below-
--> Abstraction
--> Encapsulation.
--> Inheritance.
--> Polymorphism

Abstraction:- Abstraction is basically hiding of data.
