funtion syntax:-
returnType name(){
    //funtion body(performs some assigned task)
    //return statement;
}

syntax for fuction with parameters:-
returnType name(type param1, type param2){
    //body
    return statement;
}

Functions/Methods in java also occupies memeory like variables in the call stack as stack frame. Variables of a method occupies memories inside of the particular stack frame taken by that method.
Methods occupies call stack whenever a method is called by main method and vacants the memory as soon as it executes the return statements.
Java always calls by value.
C++ follows call by reference.

Method are of two types: i) User defined methos (the method we wrote)
                        ii) Predefined/Inbuilt method (Mthods under Math class such as poe, sqrt, max etc or Scanner class's next(), nextInt() methods)


Method Scope: A variable declared inside a method is valid only inside that method. We can't directly use that variable outside that method.
for example,  public static void sum(int a, int b){
    int sum = a+b;
    System.out.println(sum); //correct
}  System.out.println(sum); //incorrect

Similarly, 
Block Scope: A variable declared inside a block is valid only inside that block. We can't directly use that variable outside that block.
for example,  public static void sum(int a, int b){
    int sum = a+b;
    {
        int c = sum + 1;
         System.out.println(c); //correct
}     
System.out.println(c); //incorrect  
}
