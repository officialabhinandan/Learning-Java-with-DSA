Divide and conquer is a process of dividing a large problem into many smaller parts and getting solution of the small problems. Then add those 
small solutions to get the final solution ofthe large problem.  
Upto now we've studied 3 types sorting algorithms(Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort) and an inbuilt sorting method(arrayName.sort()). 
Now we are going to learn Merge Sort and Quick Sort based on divide and conquer method.
The time complexity is similar with inbuilt sorting method which is O(logn).

Merge Sort:- Approah --> Step 1 >> To divide.
                         Step 2 >> Sort the individual parts of the arrayName
                         Step 3 >> Merge those part accordingly with the help of a temporary array
