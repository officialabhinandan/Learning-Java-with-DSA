ðŸ”´ðŸŸ ðŸŸ¡ Backtracking: It is basically based on the concept of divide and conquer in recursion. Backtracking uses recursion to solve it's problems.
It does so by exploring all the possiblities of any problem, unless it finds the best and feasible solution to it. Recursion occurs when a 
function calls itself repeatedly to split a problem into smaller sub-problems, until it reaches the base case.

Types of backtracking:- âšª Decision,
                        âšª Optimization, 
                        âšª Enumeration.
