Loops :-

While loops:-

while(Condition) {
    perform any task or print something ;
}

For loops:-

for(initialization; condition; updation){
    statement/operation
}

Do While loops:-
do{
    //performs some operations/prints something;
} while(conditions);

//Break Statement:- We generally use break statement inside a loop to move out of the loop when a certain condition hits. For instance, print 1 to 10 but when user number reaches to 6 move out of the loop.

// Continue Statement:- On the other hand we use continue statement inside a loop to skip an iterarion. For example, print 1 to 5 except 3.
