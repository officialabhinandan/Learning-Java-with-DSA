Array: Array is a list of elements of the same type placed in a contiguous memory location.

Creation of Array:
dataType arrayName[] = new dataType[size]
example: 
int marks[] = new int[50];
we use marks.length to find arrays length. It is a opertor, not a function.

Array follows pass by reference techniques. That means any changes occured in the method will be reflected in the main method.

Linear Search has O(n) time complexity.
Binary Search is applied on a sorted array either ascending or in descending order. It's time complexity is O(log n). For any value of of n, the value of log n is always less than n.
