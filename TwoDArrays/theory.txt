2D Array: 2D is array is same with the normal array but with two dimension which are represented by rows and columns. We treat it as a matrix form.

In normal arrays, elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. But in case of a 2D array it stores in row major and column major. This is 
applicable for computer memory, not in case of java. 
In case of java, the 2D array divided into the numbers of the arrays and stores randomly inside the memory.
